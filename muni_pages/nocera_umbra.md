## Additional Notes

* In December 2023, the digitization of parish registers of Nocera Umbra preserved in the municipal historical archive was completed as part of the [SAB Umbria project](https://sabu.cultura.gov.it/archivio-notizie/notizia?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=253&cHash=960ac033919c3df495182d6088019405) (2023–2025). A total of 65 registers (1582–1860; baptisms, marriages, deaths, confirmations, stati delle anime) were digitized, producing about 12,500 images. In January 2024, the digital reproductions were delivered to the Comune, but they are not currently available online.

# Dioceses of Umbria

In Umbria, most parish registers were transferred to municipalities together with civil status registers and are kept there today.

However, diocesan archives and parishes may still hold residual material.

## Diocese Pages

The *Regione ecclesiastica Umbria* now includes **eight dioceses**, which cover almost the same territory as the modern civil region of Umbria.

## Parish and Diocesan Holdings

While the majority of registers were moved to civil custody, church repositories still preserve some records. In general:¹

* **Parish archives** retain a portion of the registers locally, when the parish is still active.  
* **Diocesan archives** hold another portion, usually serving as a concentration point.  
* **Municipal archives** preserve many of the parish registers together with civil registers, sometimes later transferred to the relevant State Archives.

For parishes that no longer exist, holdings may be dispersed between the diocesan archive and one or more successor parishes. Even in such cases, the diocesan archive is normally the best starting point for enquiries, as it has the most centralized oversight of scattered holdings.
